# cottagecore

> Vue and Firebase. Deployed at https://naughty-brattain-84d7d4.netlify.app. Warning: unfinished + buggy.

## Interesting features

-   Login + signup via Firebase
-   Username-is-available check before signup, also, some Vuetify form rules (email is invalid, password is too short, etc)
-   Drag+drop planting interface (click on 'My Cottage', then 'Get a seed', then click+drag the chip that appears to one of the 25 'plots'.) The current state of the garden is stored in Firebase.
